Edge Clustering Coefficient
To investigate:
1. Fixed n, fixed m
   - what graphs maximize ECC?
2. Compare vs. neighborhood width
3.

. Maybe I should normalize by the number of edges,
  instead of the number of nodes.
  
  Actually, I think the right normalization is
  the number of paths

To-do:
1. Finish the version that normalizes by
   vertices, and is computed for all
   vertices.
2. Try the version that normalizes by the
   number of paths.
